# Advanced Chatbot Development Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Welcome to the ChatBot Using Machine Learning project! This repository contains all the necessary scripts and resources to build an interactive chatbot using TensorFlow. The chatbot is designed to understand user intents and provide accurate responses based on trained data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the input data for training.
- **Tokenization**: Convert text into sequences of integers for model input.
- **Model Building**: Create a neural network with embedding, pooling, and dense layers.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the model with your data and evaluate its performance.
- **Saving and Loading Models**: Save the trained model and tokenizers for future use.
- **Interactive Chat Function**: Engage in real-time conversations with the chatbot.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have TensorFlow, NumPy, and other required libraries installed.
3. **Prepare the Data**: Use the provided JSON file or your own dataset to train the chatbot.
4. **Train the Model**: Follow the training script to build and train the model.
5. **Start Chatting**: Use the interactive chat script to communicate with your trained chatbot.
